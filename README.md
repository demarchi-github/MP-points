# MP-points
MP are the *Morrow-Patterson* points which forms a unisolvent set of points for the bivariate 
polynomial interpolation of total degree in the square [-1,1] x [-1,1].
These points are also zeros of some orthogonal polynomials and allow to construct a quadrature
rule exact on bivariate polynomials of degree 2n.

The script Leb_MP.m has to be run. 
For the help, in the Command Window of Matlab, simply type

help Leb_MP

and you will get the necessary information on what does the script.
